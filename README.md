# DACSS-604-Final-Project
This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal GitHub Page and an interactive dashboard showcasing my **Customer Churn Analysis Project**. 

The GitHub Page includes:
- An "About Me" page with a brief introduction and a link to my resume.
- A "Projects" page highlighting one of my key data-driven projects: Customer Churn Analysis.

The project demonstrates my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and dashboard creation.
